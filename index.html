                            the sport model of this vehicle, so it was slow. I then
                            discovered the meaning of "built not bought" with this car. My passion for hondas grew

                            craigslist and it was some guy wanting to trade. I offered him my 88 Civic Hatchback and he
                            agreed. After putting on suspension and bolt on engine parts, the car became a real hot
                            commodity. Especially for the cops. Typically pulling me over for it being too loud or too
                            low.
                            I knew it was trouble and had to part ways. Some days I still miss it.</p>

                            the
                            most interesting facts of all. I have been playing this game for over 20 years. It all
                            started
                            when I was 12 years old. This game was soon to consume all my free time and take me away
                            from
                            everything important in life. I would beg my parents to pay the membership fee, so I could
                            hang
                            out
                            with all my buddies. When I turned 18, I felt like it was time to stop play. So occasionally
                            I
                            would log on to check my account status and see who would come on. In 2019 I was about to
                            turn
                            30 and something just told me to start playing again. Maybe it was so I didn't feel old so,
                            I did just
                            that!
                            Soon after the pandemic started, the quarantine was almost like a dream come true. Runescape
                            was
                            at its peak performace with thousands of players online. I had nothing more to do then work
                            and
                            play. Playing Runescape day and night I came across a ton of
                            programers on
                            the game. It was as if a sign was held up telling me to learn to code. In late 2021 I
                            decided it
                            was time to quit again and learn how to code.</p>

                            focusing on school. I have no idea where she put those cards, but I really hope
                            they
                            are still safe. I get the feeling they might be worth more today. I still collect and play

                            <p>Born and raised on September 20, 1989, in Los Angeles CA. As a kid I enjoyed competing in
                                sports and video games, I would play basketball all day until the sun came down, then
                                the
                                video games would come out. I spent long nights on the computer. At a young age, I would
                                complete computer repairs for friends and family for little to no money. Any earnings I
                                would get went towards making my computer more efficient. I would research all the best
                                products to make sure I would get the best bang for my buck. This is where I grew an
                                interest in building things, always having a knack for making things work properly. As I
                                got
                                older I grew a passion for cars helping my father work on his 1959 Volkswagen Bus and a
                                1972
                                Ford Mustang. After high school, I went straight to Universal Technical Institute to
                                begin
                                my career as Automotive Technician. I began as a Lube Tech at Honda and somehow managed
                                to
                                become a Qualified Line Technician for Mercedes Benz, achieving all certification needed
                                along the way. After just about 10 years in the Automotive Field, I noticed that Veteran
                                Technicians would commonly complain about the body pains caused by the industry. I soon
                                realized that maybe I do not want to be 40 and in physical pain. With my great work
                                ethic,
                                customer service skills, and automotive hands-on experience I was able to land a desk
                                job at
                                Farmers Insurance as an Automotive Property Damage Field Appriser.</p>

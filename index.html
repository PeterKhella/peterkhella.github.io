                    <li>
                        <p>Born and raised on September 20, 1989, in Los Angeles CA. As a kid I enjoyed competing in
                            sports and video games, I would play basketball all day until the sun came down, then the
                            video games would come out. I spent long nights on the computer. At a young age, I would
                            complete computer repairs for friends and family for little to no money. Any earnings I
                            would get went towards making my computer more efficient. I would research all the best
                            products to make sure I would get the best bang for my buck. This is where I grew an
                            interest in building things, always having a knack for making things work properly. As I got
                            older I grew a passion for cars helping my father work on his 1959 Volkswagen Bus and a 1972
                            Ford Mustang. After high school, I went straight to Universal Technical Institute to begin
                            my career as Automotive Technician. I began as a Lube Tech at Honda and somehow managed to
                            become a Qualified Line Technician for Mercedes Benz, achieving all certification needed
                            along the way. After just about 10 years in the Automotive Field, I noticed that Veteran
                            Technicians would commonly complain about the body pains caused by the industry. I soon
                            realized that maybe I do not want to be 40 and in physical pain. With my great work ethic,
                            customer service skills, and automotive hands-on experience I was able to land a desk job at
                            Farmers Insurance as an Automotive Property Damage Field Appriser.</p>
                        </li></br>
                        <li>
                            <p>Now one might wonder, why I would want to change my current career?</p>
                        </li></br>
                        <li>
                            <p>Yet the answer is very simple. I have a knack for making things work properly. A full-stack
                                developer knows only that, imagine the passion and possibilities that will come from being
                                on the same team of engineers for a web-based video game?</p>

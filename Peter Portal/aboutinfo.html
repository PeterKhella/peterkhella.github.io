            <h4>Peter Khella,</h4>
                <li><p>born and raise September 20 1989 in Los Angeles CA. As a kid I enjoyed competing in sports and video games, I would play basketball all day until it got dark, then the video games would come out. I spent long nights on the computer and any money I would earn would go towards upgrades to make my computer more efficient. I would research all the best products to make sure I would get he best bang for my buck. This is where I grew an interesting in building thing, always having a knack for making things work properly. As I got older I grew a passion for cars helping my father work on his 1959 Volkswagen Bus and a 1972 Ford Mustang. After high school I went straight to Universal Technical Institute to begin my career as Automotive Technician. I began as a Lube Tech at Honda and somehow managed to become a Qualified Line Technician for Mercedes Benz, achieving all certification needed along the way. After just about 10 years in the Automotive Field, I noticed that the Veteran Technicians would commonly complain about the body pains caused by the industry. I soon came to a realization that maybe I do not want to be 40 and in physical pain. With my great work ethics, customer service skills, and automotive hands on experience I was able to land a desk job at Farmers Insurance as an Automotive Property Damage Field Appriser. 
                <li><p>Now one might wonder, why I would want to change my current career?</p></li>
                <li><p>Yet they answer is very simple. I have a knack for making things work properly. A full-stack developer knows only that, imagine the passion that will come being on the same team of engineers for a web based video game?
